### **This integration only supports locations within Australia.**

This Home Assistant custom component uses the [Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au) as a source for weather information.

## Installation (There are two methods, with HACS or manual)

Install via HACS (default store) or install manually by copying the files in a new 'custom_components/bureau_of_meteorology' directory.

## Configuration

After you have installed the custom component (see above):

1. Goto the `Configuration` -> `Integrations` page.
2. On the bottom right of the page, click on the `+ Add Integration` sign to add an integration.
3. Search for `Bureau of Meteorology`. (If you don't see it, try refreshing your browser page to reload the cache.)
4. Click `Submit` so add the integration.

## Troubleshooting

Please set your logging for the custom_component to debug:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warn
  logs:
    custom_components.bureau_of_meteorology: debug
```

### Notes

1. This integration will not refresh data faster than once every 5 minutes.
2. All feature requests, issues and questions are welcome.
